*These solutions, especially the early ones, are pretty rudimentary and inefficient.
1. Weird Algorithm - simple while loop
2. Missing Number - sorted array, iterate through with a for loop. If ans not found, output either first or last element.
3. Repetitions - Iterate through string with array indexes. Keep track of current repetitions and best with max() function.
4. Increasing Array - cin >> the array. Then use a for loop and increment answer by arr[i-1] - arr[i] if the former is larger.
5. Permutations -
