1. Dice Combinations

18. Counting Tilings -- Probably the hardest problem in this set. Very hard to wrap your head around, especially if you aren't super intuitive about bitwise operations.
See the comments in the actual code for more information (not the large paragraph before the code).
Think about the constraints - n is small and m is large. We can use this for optimization. This problem requires bitmasking. We can build a solution by constructing 
columns one by one. Each block of a column can either be filled or unfilled. We can model all of these possible combinations by using a bitmask. Since each 
column is of height n, there are 2^n possible combinations for each column (subsets). It is important to know the state of the previous column for each one we are 
building so we can know what blocks are already filled (like in a horizontal tile). We initialize our 2d dp array with [1001][1<<11]. The second dimension
is the maximum possible combinations of each column 2^10 since n is at most 10, plus one because that is how the code checks if a mask is valid.
First, we read in the data and initialize our dp array with the values being -1. Then we call our solve functions with initial column 1 and mask of 0 
(because the current first column is empty). The first two if statement blocks are just for our base case for recursion and incorporating dynamic programming. 
Then, we use the gen next masks function to generate all possible masks using the current mask and places them in a vector, then it iterates through that 
vector and increments answer by calling solve of the next column using the current next_mask. It does this until it's gone through every possible combination and 
returns the answer. The gen next masks function uses set bits to determine whether it can't place a tile (already occupied) for each block of a column, whether a 
mask has been created (pushes back onto vector), and if it can place a vertical or horizontal tile. 
***In the fourth block, the  next_mask + (1 << i) call will make the block at row i in next_mask one to represent the other half of the horizontal block.*** 
This is somewhat confusing, but you have to realize the difference between current_mask, the mask we're currently on, and next_mask, the mask(s) we're
building to put into our vector and use to form other masks. Also, the condition in our base case will ensure that no horizontal blocks are placed past the edges.
