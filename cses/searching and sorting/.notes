1. Distinct Numbers - input values into set and output size of set

2. Apartments - Input vector of wantsizes and apartment sizes. sort both arrays, then use a for loop to iterate through wantsizes array. Use a while loop and var
j to keep track of current apartment element in apartment sizes vector (while wantsize[i] - k > apartments[j]). Then, if apartments[j] is between wantsizes[i] minus 
and plus k, increase answer.

3. Ferris Wheel - vector of kids weights and sort it. See if the first and last element of kids is less than or equal to max weight, and if so, increase j and
decrease n (j is pointer at start of vector, n is pointer at end of vector: they move towards the middle). If not, then only decrease n (combined is greater than
max weight). Increase ans no matter what.

4. Concert Tickets - Insert elements into multiset and use upper_bound for each maximum price. If it == s.begin(), print -1, else print *--it; Then erase the one 
instance of the element from the multiset.

5. Restaurant Customers - Set of arrays of 2 integers. For each customer, insert enter time and 1, and leaving time and -1. Then, iterate through the set and have a value
c in which the 1 and -1 are added to it (2nd element of array) and maximum c is recorded. This is the max number of customers.

6. Movie Festival - Greedy Algorithm. You always want to choose the movie that ends the earliest. Insert into set by {end time, start time} (sort by end time) 
and keep track of the last ending time. If the start time of the next movie is greater or equal to the end of the current movie, increase ans;

7. Sum of Two Values - Put values into a map<int,int> in the form of number, index. For each input, try to find m[sum-k], and if found, print the indices.

8. Maximum Subarray Sum - Read in first value and assign sum and best to that value. Then, input rest of the values and do sum = max(input, sum+input) to determine
whether to include it in the subarray. Then do best = max(sum, best). This is an important thing to know. 

9. Stick Lengths - You have to use the median for this problem (always optimal). Input the array, sort it, and find the median using the simple formula. Then, 
iterate back through the array, incrementing answer by abs(median - element) on each iteration.

10. Missing Coin Sum - Input coins vector and keep track of total value sum. Sort the vector, and keep a variable answer initally 1. Then, iterate through the vector,
access the current element, and if ans < curr, then the sum cannot be created, so output ans. Otherwise, do ans += curr and continue. The reasoning for this can be 
found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-smallest-value-represented-sum-subset-given-array/

11. Collecting Numbers 1 - Input first number, if it's not one, increase ans. Keep an array found to keep track of which variables have been found. cin >> the rest of
the array and for each input, do found[input - 1] = 1(-1 bc array indices). If curr != 1 and found[curr-2] (the number before the current) hasnt been found yet,
increase the answer by one.

12. Collecting Numbers 2 - Same thing as collecting numbers 1 to find the original answer. However, also keep track an array of indices of each number and 
an array of the numbers at each indices. Then, for each swap pair, find the numbers at those positions. Use the swap function to swap the positions in 
the nums array. Then, use a series of comparisons based on indices and number values to change a variable named change. Then, switch the indices in the indices 
array. Do ans += change and cout ans;

13. Playlist - Use a map<int, int> and a variable to keep track of the last known duplicate of an element. For each value, if it's already in the map,
then set lastknownduplicate to map[value], and curbest = i (current index) minus lastknownduplicate. Otherwise, just increase curbest by 1. Insert 
i and map[value] and do best = max(best, curbest). Output best at end.

14. Towers - Use a multiset and insert the first value into the multiset. Initiate ans = 1; Then, iterate through the inputs (k). If k >= largest element
of set, you have to make a new tower so ans++ and insert k and continue out of the loop. Otherwise, find the upper bound of k in the set 
(first value greater than k), erase it, and insert k.

15. Traffic Lights - Create a set and input 0 and x into the set. Then, create a multiset of lengths between each stop and insert x. Iterate through the inputs and
for each input k, insert it into the set, find what position it is using .find(), and use variables curleft =  k - *prev(it); and curright = *next(it) - k;
These values are distances that are to the left and right of k (since we split the road up at k). Then we insert those two values into our lengths 
multiset and erase the total distance (curleft + curright) from our multiset, then output the reverse begin of the multiset. 

16. Josephus Problem 1 - Create vector of numbers, then use a while loop while the size is greater than one. Use a for loop to print the current round of numbers
and put the rest of the numbers in another 'survivors' vector. Afterwards, if the initial vector was even, our vector just becomes the survivors vector.
However, if it is of odd size, we have to insert the last element of our survivors vector to the beginning of it, then repeat the loop.

17. Josephus Problem 2 - Use an ordered_set policy-based data structure for efficiency. Insert all of our elements into the ordered set, then define a value p that equals 
k % n. Use the find_by_order function to print out the value at position p in the set, erase that element, and do p = (p+k) % s.size, making sure 
that s.size() is greater than zero.

18. Nested Ranges Check - Complicated Problem. We define a range struct with int left, right, and the original index of the variable (because we sort them).
We also redefine the comparison/sort operator so that if the left values are tied, we sort the right values by whichever one is greater (this is important
for our algorithm). First, we create a vector of ranges and insert our values. Then, we sort the vector. Firstly, to determine if our ranges are contained
by another range, define a variable max for the largest right bound. The way our vector is sorted, if inputs[i].r <= maxi, then that range has to be 
contained by another. Otherwise, we update our max right bound variable. We store these results into our contained array, to be printed later. Next, to 
determine if our ranges contain another range, define a variable min for our minimum right bound and iterate through the vector starting from the back. 
Again, based on the way we sorted our vector, if inputs[i].r >= mini, then it must contain another range. Note: we update the contains and contained array
through our .index range variable, as we have to remember the original index of our input ranges. 

19. Nested Ranges Count - Harder, more complicated problem. Use the same range struct and vector of ranges, but also use an ordered_set of pairs of 
integers. Input and sort the same way as problem 18. For contained, use a for loop and insert inputs[i].r and -1*i into our set. Based on the way 
an ordered set works, we set contained[original index] to the size of the set minus the order_of_key of the inserted values. We do the same thing for 
contains except we start at the back of our vector, and we set contained[original index] only to the order_of_key of the inserted values.

20. Room Allocation - Another pretty complicated problem. Use a vector of pairs of pairs to store enter time, leaving time, and index, then sort the vector.
Make another vector for the assignment of the rooms, each value initialized at -1. Make a variable roomId that represents the current room that has not been 
in use yet, starting at 1. Then, make a priority queue of pairs where the smallest value is on top. Then, iterate through every customer. If the size of the priority queue
is zero (no rooms in use), set roomAssign[index] to roomId, and push the departure time and the roomId onto the priority queue, and increase roomId by one. 
Otherwise, if there is a room or rooms in use, if the .first value of the priority queue (the departure time) is less than the current arrival time, this means
the room is free and we can assign that room to the current customer. Otherwise, there are no free rooms and we have to make another room for the customer.

21. Factory Machines - This is a binary search problem. Below a specific time, you can't make enough products, but after a specific time, you can. 
So, we create our sorted vector and do a standard binary search. Once we have a middle bound, we iterate through the vector and find the total amount of 
products that we can make in that time, using the variable noOverFlow to prevent ll overflows. We can also prevent this by using a break statement once
products >= t; After we calculate total products, if products >= t, then we cut off the 2nd half of our data set and if ans > mb, ans = mb. Otherwise, we
cut out the 1st half of our data set.

22. Tasks and Deadlines - This is a greedy algorithm where the optimal solution is to always pick the event that has the smallest duration.

23. Reading Books - No matter what, minimum time will be AT LEAST the length of the largest book * 2. Otherwise, it is the sum of all of the books.

24. Sum of Three Values - Create a vector of pairs of integers to keep track of numbers and their indices. Then, sort the vector. This approach uses 
a two pointers-esque method. This approach is O(n^2). The first loop is the left pointer which starts at index 0 and finds the value x - v[lp].first, which
is the total value needed by the other two elements in the array. Then, use another for-loop starting from lp+1 and a right pointer at n-1. Decrease rp until
v[i].first + v[rp].first is not greater than x2. If they equal x2, then print out the indices and return. 

25. Sum of Four Values - Same approach as three values but add another loop and add constraints to make sure the pointers don't overlap each other.

26. Nearest Smaller Values - Simple problem using stack data structure. Use a stack of pairs of integers. For each element, while the size of the stack is 
greater than zero and stack.top().first > current input, pop the top of the stack. Either the size of the stack will be zero or the current element on top of 
the stack is less than the input value. 

27. Subarray Sums 1 - This is a two-pointers solution. You can also use a frequency map with prefix sums (better), which is shown in the next problem. Read the
input into a vector, initialize left and right pointers, and while sum < x, increase the right pointer. If sum == x, ans++, and at the end of the loop decrease
sum by v[lp] (lp will be incremented by 1 every loop). 

28. Subarray Sums 2 - This solution utilizes prefix sums. Create a frequency map of the prefix sums and set mp[0] to 1. Then, iterate through the vector, and 
update the partial sum by the value in each iteration. Then, increase your answer by mp[partialSum - x], and increment mp[partialSum]++; This is hard to 
visualize in your head -- it's better to write it out. 

29. Subarray Divisibility - This is another problem that uses a frequency map but it is kind of hard to understand. It uses modulus logic and solves the problem
efficiently that way. Need to revisit the approach for this one.

30. Subarray Distinct Values - A little more complicated than it seems. Use a set and multiset. Uses a two pointers method, where if a bool e is true, it inserts
rp into the multiset (inserts rp into set regardless), and if the size of the regular set is less than or equal to k, it increments ans by ans + (rb-lb), because
all of the subarrays within rb and lb will have distinct numbers. Otherwise, it erases v[lb] from the set if it is present in the multiset only once, and removes 
one instance of it from the multiset. It increments lb by 1, decreases rb by 1 (will remain the same after loop iterates again), and sets e to false. This is also
one that needs to be visualized.

31. Array Division - Binary search problem. The lb is set to the largest element in the array because that is the minimum possible value ans can be. Our middle bound
is our current testing point to see if we can make a section of the array that size. Uses a for loop to iterate through and every time sum is greater than 
middle bound, it creates a divison at that point. At the end of the loop, if divisions > k, the number is too small, so set lb to mb+1 and otherwise if (if the 
divisions are valid), if ans > mb, set ans = mb, and set rb to mb-1;

32. Sliding Median - There is a very easy approach using an ordered_set and the find_by_order function. You can also use a more tedious approach with
simpler data structures. In this solution, you have a left set and right set of pairs of integers to store values and indices. There are special
cases for when k == 1 and k == 2. Otherwise, create a vector of pairs of integers and input the first k numbers and their indices, then sort them. Then, from
0 to k/2 + (k%2), insert the elements from the vector into the left set, and the rest into the right set. Here, our median of the current window will be 
the reverse begin of the left set. Then, using a loop, erase the element that is now out of the window from whichever stack it is in. Then, if the new element
to insert is greater than the last element of left set, insert it into the right set, otherwise insert it into the left. Then, move elements either from left 
to right or right to left until the size of the left set is k/2+k%2, then output the last element of the left set. 

33. Sliding Cost - Combination of Sliding Median and Stick Lengths problem. Use the same 2 set approach as the last problem. Special cases for k = 1 and 2.
Essentially, you want to keep track of the sum of the elements in both the left and right sets, then output the following formula using the median, lsum, rsum, 
and size of each stack: sz(l)*med - lsum + rsum - sz(r)*med. There may be better solutions to this problem. 

34. Movie Festival II - Continuation of movie festiaval 1. Still use a greedy algorithm by sorting vector by end times. But also keep a multiset
to keep track of the end times of the movies that all of the k people are watching. Then, iterate through each movie time in the vector, and find the 
upper bound of the start time (if not s.begin()). Then, decrement the pointer by 1 and remove it from the set, then insert the ending time of the current movie
into the set. The important idea is that you want to use the person who ends the LATEST before the start time of the current movie for an optimal solution.

35. Maximum Subarray Sum II - This is a pretty difficult problem, so look up another solution elsewhere. You bascially make a vector of prefix sums from the
input, then create a multiset and insert elements from a to b. Then, you start at i, and compare maximum values of ans to the rbegin of the multiset minus 
v[i-1]. Again, this is a pretty complicated problem, so visualize it better with another solution.
